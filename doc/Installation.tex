This section of the manual describes how to install the 'Economics for RAVEN'  plug-in and use it from within RAVEN \cite{RAVEN}.

\subsection{Installing the plug-in}
The CashFlow plugin is distributed with RAVEN. If you just want to use the plugin and are not interested in developing additional features or bug-fixes for it, just make sure that you have access to the plugin repository and you will automatically get it when installing RAVEN.
For more information, please refere to the RAVEN manual.

\subsection{Accessing the plug-in from within RAVEN}
The plugin can be accessed as a special subtype of the External model. The syntax is given in Listing \ref{lst:CashFlowfromRAVEN}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML,morekeywords={anAttribute},caption=Call CashFlow from RAVEN input., label=lst:CashFlowfromRAVEN]
<ExternalModel name="Cash_Flow" subType="CashFlow">
  <variables> Input and output variables needed by CashFlow  </variables>
  <ExternalXML node="Economics" xmlToLoad="Cash_Flow_input.xml"/>
</ExternalModel>
\end{lstlisting}
